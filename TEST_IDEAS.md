# Ante Test Ideas

Weâ€™re excited you want to contribute to Ante! In addition to helping build a safer Web3 ecosystem, writing an Ante Test is a fantastic way for new Solidity developers to learn the basics (for example, anon Paradigm engineer [FrankieIsLost](https://github.com/FrankieIsLost) wrote an Ante Test early in their Web3 career).

Here's how you can help:

## Contribute test ideas
Have protocols you want tested? Submit Ante Test ideas to the list below or in [Discord](https://discord.gg/ante)! You can check out [Coming up with an Invariant](https://docs.ante.finance/antev05/for-devs/writing-an-ante-test/invariant-ideas) for examples of protocol invariants you could write a test for.

## Contribute test code
1. Select any test on the list that isn't already picked up by someone else
2. **Add yourself to the Test Writer column** (so no one ends up duplicating someone else's work!)
3. Happy test writing! See [Writing an Ante Test](https://docs.ante.finance/antev05/for-devs/writing-an-ante-test) for a step-by-step guide.
